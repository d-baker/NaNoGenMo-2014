Baroque Encodings: A Degenerative Novel
=======================================

Created for [NaNoGenMo 2014](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014). Please excuse the code, it's a mess...and also probably not quite bug free.

About
-----
The initial chapter of the novel is generated by substituting words in sentences taken from (human-written) novels, and combining this with short conjoining words and phrases that provide a (slight) sense of narrative.

In each subsequent chapter, the text is slowly mangled as the previous chapter is fed into a sentence-generating algorithm that chains words based on how often they occur together.

Usage
-----
This NaNoGenMo is designed so that you can generate your own, customised novel! Just download the zip file or clone this repo, then run `bot.py`. The novel will be generated as a plain text file. Be warned: anything longer than a couple of thousand words will probably take a long time/heat up your computer/house/whatever.

Two different beautifully typeset PDF runs of the novel can be downloaded from [here](http://memoriata.com/dropbox/baroque_encodings_v1.pdf) and [here](http://memoriata.com/dropbox/baroque_encodings_v2.pdf) respectively. The first version is around ~4000 words (an early test run that turned out too good to trash) and the second is ~50000 words.

Credits

Various portions of the corpus draw on [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora), [Project Gutenberg's Moby word lists](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3201), [SCOWL](http://wordlist.aspell.net/) and the infamous [everyword](https://twitter.com/everyword) list.

The sentence structures used to generate the novel are mostly taken from books I've been reading recently, sometimes modified.
